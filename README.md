# Get Ready to Monkey Around!
Here is the code for Aidan's Masters thesis, graduating from Colorado State University with an MS in Cell & Molecular Biology.

This code is the basis for the article ***Title of the paper*** with special thanks for Dr. Mark Cline of Wake Forrest University
for providing the data and establishing such a remarkable playground for health AI enthusiasts.

For more in-depth documentation about the code, visit this repository's wiki, but as an overview, 
this code both tests if biomarkers and health outcomnes within a rhesus monkey population can be predicted using AI/ML.

In unison, I developed novel AI tools to make accurate health-related predictions, and vett differrent ML models 
for this personalized medicine application.

The three aims of this work are:
1. Develop tools to predict blood biomarker levels
2. Develop tools to predict health outcomes
3. Develop tools to predict radiation exposure (dose)

I found that AI can be used to make highly accurate biomarker predictions and dose predictions, 
though the health outcome prediciton models need a little work before they can be used clinicaly. 

Finaly, I hope this work lives on, and thus, I have pipelined the different ML models and 
I have crafted a rudimentary personalized medicine API dubbed `lymph_predictor_2000` and `dose_predictor_2000` 
for lymphocyte and dose predictions on new data.

Thank you for your interest in this work, please reach out with any questions!
